'''
Given an array of length N, where N denotes the number of iterative statements. Each item-pair in the array 
represents two elements, with the 1st value (V) indicating the upper boundary for the iteration to take
place (can be inclusive or exclusive depending on the 2nd value) and the 2nd value (Boolean data type -> true/false
depending on your chosen language) indicating whether the upper boundary (V) is inclusive or exclusive

Write a function that outputs an array in which each element represents the number of iterations
