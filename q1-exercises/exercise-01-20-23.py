# Exercise 3: Lesson 49 
# Make Some Variables!
########################################################################
# Define a variable named city and set it equal to any string
city = "Chicago"

# Define a variable named price and set it equal to any float
price = 15.23

# Define a variable named high_score and set it equal to any int
high_score = 213

# Exercise 4: Lesson 51
# String Escape Sequences
########################################################################
# Set the message variable equal to any string containing a new-line escape sequence
message = "Hello, world!\n"

# Add a string to the mountains variable that when printed results in: /\/\/\
# You will need to use an escape sequence more than once!
mountains = "/\/\/\\"
print(mountains)

# Set the quotation variable to any string that contains an escaped double quotation mark
quotation = "\"Hello world\""
print(quotation)

# Exercise 5: Lesson 53
# String Concatenation Exercise
########################################################################
# Set the variable called greeting  to some greeting, e.g. "hello".
# Set the variable called name  to some name, e.g. "Heisenberg".
# Then set the variable called greet_name  so that it concatenates greeting , name , and a space " " between them.
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Heisenberg"
greet_name = greeting + " " + name
print(greet_name)
